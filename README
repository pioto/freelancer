This is our final project for INFSCI 2710. The basic layout:

cgi-bin/ - contains the actual script to go in cgi-bin. This is just a
thin wrapper around Freelancer::WebApp.

lib/ - contains the bulk of our code.

   lib/Freelancer/WebApp.pm - the "Controller" for the application --
       built on CGI::Application, handles HTTP requests, and does "the
       right thing, then calls templates to actually display "stuff"

templates/ - contains templates for the HTML pages.
